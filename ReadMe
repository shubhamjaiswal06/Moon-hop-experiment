This repository is to calculate the distance moved by Vikram lander after the hop experiment has been conducted on the moon.
The official statement from ISRO says the lander is moved by a distance of 30-40 cms.
Using optical flow algorithm in computer vision, I tried to calculate the distance by utilising the camera image released in public domain from ISRO.
This calculated distance should match with the distance which ISRO has released in public (30-40 cms).
The camera instrinsic parameters are assumed based on data available on public domain like ISRO and NASA website and some wikipedia pages.
